### Project Background

IT Service Management (ITSM) is an important corporate function responsible for leveraging innovation to increase value, maximizing user productivity, providing end-to-end tech services, and so much more.

IT departments are facing the business issue of dealing with helpdesk incidents that are (a) incorrectly assigned (b) out of the scope of what the corresponding team should be responsible for. This leads to an inefficient allocation of department resources the misalignment of team goals, responsibilities, and accountability. As a result, expectations.




### Project Challanges
* Getting the data we need to build a reliable NLP model -- can the data be trusted? 
* How can we ensure data quality?
* What are the steps for data preprocessing?
* What kind of solution will solve this issue while pleasing stakeholders (IT executives and organization end-users?)


### Project Highlights

* Advanced explaratory analytics to understand data
* Advanced preprocessing to eliminate bad data, handle text corpus, and deal with missing data
* Utilized under/over sampling to manage a severly imbalanced classification problem
* Developed a model evaluation pipeline for highest performing classifier with the best parameters using grid search (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Gradient Boosted Trees)
* Optimized for precision over recall and accuracy

### Project Solution

* Designed a successful model logistic regression with an 87% precision score
* Delivered a user-facing product with a simple UI and effective data communication of model
* Saved thousands of $'s 
* Convinced stakeholders of the importance of treating data as asset; importance of quality data collection
